# Serverless Integration Event Handling with DynamoDB

This project demonstrates a serverless application for handling integration events using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. It provides functionality for creating orders and publishing integration events associated with those orders.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- AWS CLI (version X.X.X)
- Serverless Framework (version X.X.X)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jerolan/serverless-example.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd serverless-example
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up AWS credentials:

   Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

## Usage
